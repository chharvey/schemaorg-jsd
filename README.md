# Usage

## Install
```

```

## Validate Against Schema.org JSON Schema

This module exports an asynchronous validation function.
It returns a Promise object, so you may use `await` or you may use standard `Promise` prototype methods.
Read the JSDoc in `./index.js` for further details.

```js
const {sdoValidate} = require('schemaorg-jsd')

async function run() {
// use any javascript object
let school = {
  '@context': 'http://schema.org/',
  '@type': 'Place',
  name: `Blacksburg, ${usState('Virginia').code}`,
}
school['@id'] = 'http://www.blacksburg.gov/'
try {
  let is_valid_place = sdoValidate(school, 'Place') // validate against the Place schema
  console.log(await is_valid_place) // return `true` if the document passes validation
} catch (e) { // throw an `Error` if the document fails validation
  console.error(e)
  console.error(e.filename) // file where the invalidation occurred
  console.error(e.details) // more json-schema specifics; see <https://github.com/epoberezkin/ajv#validation-errors>
}

// require a package
let me = require('./me.json')
await sdoValidate(me, 'Person')

// use a string (relative path) of the filename
let org = './my-org.jsonld'
await sdoValidate(org, 'Organization')
}
```


## Validate Against Your Own JSON Schema
You can use [ajv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ajv) to validate any document against any JSON schema.
Normally you would do this by adding the schema to the ajv instance, and then checking the document.
However, if you write a schema that references one of this project’s Schema.org schema (via `$ref`),
you must add them both to the ajv instance.

Due to the interconnectedness of all Schema.org schemata, it’s faster to add them all at once.
This project’s exported `SCHEMATA` object is an array of Schema.org JSON schema,
pre-packaged and ready to add.
```js
const Ajv = require('ajv')
const sdo_jsd = require('schemaorg-jsd')

let my_schema = {
  "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#",
  "$id": "https://chharvey.github.io/example.jsd",
  "title": "Array<Thing>",
  "description": "An array of Schema.org Things.",
  "type": "array",
  "items": { "$ref": "https://chharvey.github.io/schemaorg-jsd/schema/Thing.jsd" }
}
let my_data = [
  { "@context": "http://schema.org/", "@type": "Thing", "name": "Thing 1" },
  { "@context": "http://schema.org/", "@type": "Thing", "name": "Thing 2" }
]

async function run() {
  const SCHEMATA = sdo_jsd.getSchemata()
let ajv = new Ajv().addSchema(await SCHEMATA)
ajv.validate(my_schema, my_data)
// Note that the `Ajv#validate()` method’s parameters are reversed from this package’s `sdoValidate()`:
// `Ajv#validate(schema, data)`
// `sdoValidate(data, schemaTitle)`
}
```

## View the “API”
A set of [TypeDoc](http://typedoc.org/) declarations describing types and their properties.
They are identical to the specs at [schema.org](https://schema.org/),
but you can import the source code in your own project for
[TypeScript](http://www.typescriptlang.org/) compilation.

```
$ cd node_modules/schemaorg-jsd
$ npm install
$ npm run build
$ cd -
$ # open ./docs/api/index.html in your browser
```
**(Note: These docs will be published online soon, so you won’t have to build locally.)**

```ts
import * as sdo from 'schemaorg-jsd' // TEMP: this import might change
class Person {
  private _name: string
  /**
   * Construct a new Person object.
   * @param jsondata an object validating against the schemaorg-jsd `Person` schema
   */
  constructor(jsondata: sdo.Person) {
    this._name = jsondata.name
  }
}
```


# Background Info

## JSON
[JSON](http://www.json.org/) (JavaScript Object Notation) is a data interchange format,
based off of the syntax used to define object literals in JavaScript.

## JSON Schema
[JSON Schema](http://json-schema.org/) is a vocabulary, in JSON format,
that allows you to validate JSON documents.
In other words, a particular JSON schema tells you whether your JSON instance file is written correctly,
if you choose to validate your instance against that schema.
JSON schema documents *themselves* must also be valid JSON, *as well as* validate against the
[JSON Meta-Schema specification](http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema).
The JSON Meta-Schema tells you whether your JSON schema document, if you have one, is written correctly.
The official MIME Type of JSON schema documents is `application/schema+json`.

*Note: this project uses a `.jsd` (“JSON Schema Definition”) file extension to name JSON schema files, though
there is no prevailing convention on JSON schema file extensions.*

## JSON-LD
[JSON-LD](https://json-ld.org/) (JSON Linked Data) is a syntax used to mark up data in a consistent way.
Rather than everyone using their own data types, JSON-LD standardizes the markup, making it easy
for people and data types to communicate.
JSON-LD has some rules, for example, an object’s `@id` property must be a string.
Therefore, to enforce these rules, JSON-LD documents should validate against the
[JSON-LD Schema](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/json-ld/json-ld.org/master/schemas/jsonld-schema.json).
The official MIME Type of JSON-LD documents is `application/ld+json`,
and JSON-LD files typically have file extension `.jsonld`.

## Schema.org
[Schema.org](https://schema.org/) Is a vocabulary that you can use to describe data.
These are semantic descriptions that have well-defined meanings.
For example, people using different human languages could refer to the unique identifier http://schema.org/givenName
and know precisely what others are talking about: a person’s given name.
The Schema.org vocabulary is syntax-agnostic, meaning you can use whatever format you want to mark up your data.
[Microdata](https://www.w3.org/TR/microdata/) is one common syntax, and JSON-LD is another.

## TypeScript
[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) is a strongly-typed language that compiles to JavaScript.
Some of the biggest features of TypeScript include *interfaces* and *type aliases*, which, respectively,
describe the “shape” (fields and methods) and “structure” (properties) that an object may have.
This project includes interfaces and type aliases for Schema.org Classes and Properties, respectively,
so that you can write a well-typed API for your project.

## Putting It All Together
You can semantically mark up your data using the Schema.org vocabulary with JSON-LD syntax.
If you have a TypeScript API, you can import this project’s TypeScript to catch any type errors before runtime.
Then, to prevent additional runtime errors or SEO mistakes, you can validate your markup against
the JSON schemata (multiple “schemas”) in this project.
